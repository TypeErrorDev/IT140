Living Room:
"Moonlight filters through dusty windows, casting long shadows across Victorian furniture. A flashlight catches your eye, its metal surface gleaming on an antique side table."
Study:
"Leather-bound books line mahogany shelves, and an old brass lamp flickers uncertainly. An aged journal rests open on the desk, its pages rustling in a nonexistent breeze."
Master Bedroom:
"Heavy velvet curtains frame clouded windows, and a four-poster bed looms in the darkness. Ornate candles stand arranged in a peculiar pattern on the bedside table."
Library:
"Towering bookshelves stretch into shadows above, and the musty scent of ancient knowledge fills the air. An ancient mirror hangs between the shelves, its surface rippling like water."
Storage Room:
"Cobwebs drape over forgotten treasures, and dust motes dance in the dim light. A box of matches sits conspicuously atop a stack of weathered crates."
Conservatory:
"Moonlight streams through cracked glass panels, illuminating overgrown plants. Among the twisted vines, magic crystals pulse with an inner light."
Wine Cellar:
"The temperature drops as you descend, and the walls seem to close in. A piece of ritual chalk rests on a barrel, marking it with strange symbols."
Ritual Chamber:
"An otherworldly energy pervades this circular room. Mysterious symbols cover the walls, waiting to be activated by the items you've gathered."

Library: "The mirror's surface ripples as you take it, distorting your reflection as you hurry from the library."
Storage Room: "The matches rattle in their box as you pocket them, leaving the storage room's musty confines."
Conservatory: "The crystals pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat as you depart the conservatory's green gloom."
Wine Cellar: "The chalk leaves a faint residue on your fingers as you climb back up from the cellar's depths."


When leaving without the item:
Living Room: "You leave the flashlight behind, shadows seeming to deepen in your wake."
